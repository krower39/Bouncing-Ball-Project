# Bouncing-Ball-Project
Here is where I made a bare bones pong replica. The goal was to bounce a ball in both the x and y directions without disappearing off the screen.
There shouldn't need to be any installs required that I am aware of, this is HTML but I am new to it.
Future fixes for myself could be to find ways to "score" in pong and then reset the ball.
